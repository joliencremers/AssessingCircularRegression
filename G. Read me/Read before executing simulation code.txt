First the datasets for simultion need to be created using:

	-Create data simulation studies.R

Analyses for the slice sampler are found under:

	-Code for obtaining data in simulation tables Slice.R

Analyses for the MH sampler are found under:

	-Code for obtaining data in simulation tables MH new2.R

To check convergence:

	-Convergence checks and figures slice and MH sampler.R

To obtain results after adding an additional burn-in:

	-Obtain post simulation summary stats MH new2.R
	-Obtain post simulation summary stats Slice.R
